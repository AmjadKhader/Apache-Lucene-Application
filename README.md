## Documentation

This README file only contains basic setup instructions.  For more comprehensive documentation, visit:

### Basic steps:

  1. Install Lucene 8.11.1.
  2. Make sure to use Java 8.

We'll assume that you know how to get and set up the JDK - if you
don't, then we suggest starting at https://jdk.java.net/ and learning
more about Java, before returning to this README. Lucene runs with
Java 8 or later. Also, Lombok plugin is required.
